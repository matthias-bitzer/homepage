*Starting your journey in machine learning? These 10 papers provide essential foundations for understanding the field.*

## Introduction

The machine learning field has produced thousands of papers, but certain works stand out as foundational. This curated list helps newcomers build a solid theoretical foundation.

## The Papers

### 1. Backpropagation (1986)
**"Learning representations by back-propagating errors"**  
*Rumelhart, Hinton, Williams*

The paper that made training deep neural networks practical. Understanding backpropagation is essential for any deep learning work.

### 2. Support Vector Machines (1995)
**"Support-Vector Networks"**  
*Cortes, Vapnik*

Introduced SVMs, demonstrating how to find optimal decision boundaries. Still relevant for understanding kernel methods and margin-based classification.

### 3. Random Forests (2001)
**"Random Forests"**  
*Leo Breiman*

Ensemble learning that remains one of the most robust and interpretable methods. Essential for understanding bagging and feature importance.

### 4. Dropout (2014)
**"Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting"**  
*Srivastava, Hinton, et al.*

A remarkably simple yet effective regularization technique that's now standard in deep learning.

### 5. Adam Optimizer (2014)
**"Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization"**  
*Kingma, Ba*

The default optimizer for most deep learning projects. Understanding adaptive learning rates is crucial.

### 6. Batch Normalization (2015)
**"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training"**  
*Ioffe, Szegedy*

Made training very deep networks practical by normalizing layer inputs.

### 7. ResNet (2015)
**"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"**  
*He, Zhang, Ren, Sun*

Introduced skip connections, enabling training of networks with hundreds of layers. Won ImageNet 2015.

### 8. Attention Is All You Need (2017)
**"Attention Is All You Need"**  
*Vaswani et al.*

Introduced the Transformer architecture, revolutionizing NLP and beyond. Foundation for BERT, GPT, and modern LLMs.

### 9. BERT (2018)
**"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers"**  
*Devlin et al.*

Demonstrated the power of pre-training and transfer learning in NLP.

### 10. An Image is Worth 16x16 Words (2020)
**"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"**  
*Dosovitskiy et al.*

Vision Transformers (ViT) brought transformer success to computer vision.

## How to Read Papers

1. **First pass**: Read abstract, introduction, and conclusion
2. **Second pass**: Understand the methodology and key figures
3. **Third pass**: Implement or reproduce the results

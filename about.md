  <p>Hi, thanks for checking out my machine learning blog!</p>
  <p>My name is Matthias and I am currently enrolled in a PhD program at the Bosch Center of Artificial Intelligence (BCAI). My research spans Gaussian processes, active learning and Bayesian optimization, but I am also interested in broader subjects such as generative modeling or interesting neural network architectures (such as e.g. Transfomers). Feel free to comment my blog posts and start some discussions!</p>
